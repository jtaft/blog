In the sense that, as an American you have to pick a career, preferably the most lucrative one you can going in with the intention to make as much money as you can. This creates this pressure to measure success in terms of dollars leaving jobs like doctors and lawyers as very sexy vocations. With the .com boom and people finding success at a very young age doing programming it seems to have been added to this list. This has also resulted in entrepreneurship becoming a very sexy thing to do because of the influx of investment capital in the space and has resulted in mainstream popularity (I&#39;m not good at keeping up with what is and isn&#39;t &quot;mainstream&quot;, but I think the TV show Shark Tank is a good enough indication of it&#39;s popularity).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Back to Programming, I&#39;m not terrible at it. I can always figure out a way to solve the problem at hand, but I&#39;m not perfect. I sometimes overlook very trivial things. I think most of my mistakes are due to being to close to the problem, or losing interest in a problem after I figure out a solution causing me to not take the time to revisit and clean things up as much as I should. Either way, I do believe I&#39;m good enough to make a &quot;Career&quot; at it, but that&#39;s not why I went to school for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I hadn&#39;t thought about why I chose to pursue an education in Computer Science for a long time. I think in the front of my mind I told myself it was an obvious decision as if I somehow peered through the veil into my future and saw that it was the most lucrative &quot;Career&quot; I could have, so I had no choice but to go into it, but that was not my decision process at all. In reality, I was just an 18 year old kid who had a lot of hobbies. I loved mechanic work, painting, taking stuff apart, trying to fix electronics, 3D modeling, and a little bit of coding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>I would have loved to be a mechanic, but it doesn&#39;t pay that well unless you really specialize, and in order to do that I&#39;d probably need to get a Mechanical Engineering degree. The Arts seemed like a cool idea, but I don&#39;t really enjoy starving. That kind of left me with computers/electronics which would be a Computer Science degree or Electrical Engineering. In the end, I narrowed it down to Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science, but I was also very interested in entrepreneurship. I was a fan of Diggnation, Hak5, TWIT, and all those guys at Revision3. I actually submitted a question to the Ask Jay show where Jay Adelson answers questions about entrepreneurship. You can watch that </span><span class="c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Ds2dehtr0PXo&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1672906948760539&amp;usg=AOvVaw15NbIISYES_uZCWDdT3OkM">here</a></span><span class="c0">. I just asked him how much schooling he recommended, if any.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At the time, I was thinking about not going to college. I didn&#39;t really like school much and was ready to be done with it, but between Jay and my parents I was convinced I should give it a try, so I needed to choose which one I wanted to do. I figured they were all three pretty lucrative so I needed a different metric to help me decide. At first I thought enjoyment would be the proper metric to decide because I&#39;d heard you don&#39;t want to be doing a job you don&#39;t enjoy for the rest of your life, but I had an equal amount of enjoyment (and frustration) doing all of these things, so I&#39;m not sure I could make that distinction. I then actually decided that the best metric would be the one I was least comfortable with. If I picked the one that was the hardest for me now I would theoretically get the most value out of college and it would improve my average knowledge across my hobbies. This for me was Programming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At this point I had only written some small scripts for Gimp and Blender, and also wrote some small programs to take input and give responses based on the input. I&#39;d basically followed a tutorial through variables (basic data types: strings, arrays, dict, int, ect.), I/0, and loops. I did not have a great understanding of Classes, Inheritance, recursion, or a proper grasp of any data structure implementation such as trees, hashes, ect. My biggest motivation was C++. At the time everything I did was in Python, but everything I read said that at a basic level pretty much everything was written in C. Hell even Python is compiled down to C code, so I probably needed to learn it in order to be proficient at programming. I had tried to figure it out on my own reading tutorials and walkthroughs online, but I could not make sense of it (Now I can see that this was because I did not have a good understanding of Classes so it made it hard to get past some of the basic C++ tutorials. In school after I understood classes I picked up C++ quickly with the only hurdle being pointers). At the time, I was fairly convinced that I would never figure it out, so I decided I would go to school for Programming because if I could know how to code I would truly have full control over hardware, and that&#39;s probably more valuable to me than creating the hardware in the first place by going into electrical engineering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Knowing this doesn&#39;t really give me a lot of confidence in my career choice. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love to code when it&#39;s interesting. It&#39;s just really hard for me to find anything in the industry that is super interesting to me right now, and if it is somewhat interesting I&#39;m not likely going to get the job because on paper it seems I don&#39;t have any &quot;experience&quot;, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any qualitative way to determine if someone is a good fit for a position. The types of jobs that are willing to take a chance on someone who doesn&#39;t have much &quot;experience&quot; seem to be targeted toward businesses that really just want to store data move data around and display data in a user friendly way and if you stray too far away from a minimum viable product then everyone is going to lose their collective minds. &quot;It&#39;s too hard! You&#39;ll never get that done in time! We have a certain velocity we need to keep, and we need to complete all our stories before the next release!&quot; &quot;Yeah, but... Can&#39;t I try.. It would be really cool...&quot; How am I supposed to argue my point when they&#39;ve already made up some time complexity in their heads that doesn&#39;t necessarily match mine. Granted, I do tend to underestimate how long it will take to do something, but I&#39;m of the mindset that taking a little extra time and doing something really cool is better than doing something mediocre. If you&#39;re in a truly competitive market the better product will win out, so interesting features are considerably more valuable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This rant is not to be taken as a slight against my past, present, or future employers. It is just an observation that seems to permeate into the minds of certain people I&#39;ve come across. I believe this may be a sign of having low in the personality trait openness (if you&#39;re not into psychology this personality trait measures how open you are to new ideas) and that people with low trait openness could potentially be very attracted to programming because it is very logical and there is a set of frameworks and conventions you can adopt for just about any situation and it&#39;s easy to argue for these &quot;best practices&#39;&#39; because they&#39;re familiar because they&#39;re all taught in school. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re bad. I just don&#39;t enjoy sacrificing simplicity for a design philosophy. I&#39;m also not saying that low trait openness is a bad thing. If you&#39;re unfamiliar intelligence is a completely separate trait and you can be very intelligent and not be open to new ideas that aren&#39;t grounded in hard facts. People are also known to get lower in openness as they get older, so that&#39;s also a factor. Being low in openness is really good for getting work done. It means you don&#39;t waste time on extraneous ideas and can work much faster. Being high in openness means it&#39;s much harder to rule out possible better solutions without trying them. Let alone rule out the possibility that there exists a better solution. In this way you can easily end up in an analysis paralysis situation procrastinating because the current solutions all seem equally valid with no real way to determine which would be best, but it seems that there should be some non-obvious solution that is way better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With all this being said, I was regretting my decision to become a Programmer. Until I reflected on how I got here and had an epiphany. I&#39;m not a Programmer. I&#39;m a very diverse person with very diverse interests, but I&#39;ve been ignoring my hobbies in the pursuit of a &quot;Career&quot; that everyone has told me I need. When in fact I don&#39;t feel that way at all. This is just a hobby that I am fortunate enough to get to do 8hrs a day 5 days a week for money. If I don&#39;t want to do it in my free time, no wonder, I spend 8 hrs a day working on that hobby. What about the rest? I don&#39;t have to sacrifice all of my time to coding. That&#39;s not me. I need time to run, work on my car, paint, fix stuff, break stuff, and otherwise tinker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This mindset has really helped me relieve this deep seeded pressure to work towards my &quot;Career&quot; as much as I can. I don&#39;t need to be working on a project right now that involves code. If it really feels exciting that&#39;s a different story, but I need to work on the hobby that makes me excited right now, and not the one that seems to better my career, or has some potential entrepreneurial outcome that involves some form of monetary success.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The last time I went to get my haircut was on my birthday at this little barber shop owned by this 83 year old man. He was the only one in the place when I showed up at 7am to get my haircut before work. He quickly got me on the topic of where I worked and what I did for a living as he slowly, gently, and methodically started cutting my hair. When he asked me what I did I told him I was a Computer Programmer. I got the impression that he didn&#39;t know much about current technology (Why would he? He&#39;s 83!), but he said something along the lines of &quot;Well, if you can make a living at it.&quot; As if he was trying to say I&#39;m not a huge fan of computers, but it seems pretty lucrative and if you can make a living that&#39;s enough. This view somehow struck me different than it ever has. I have obviously heard that just making a living is good enough before, but coming from this very old man who had lived a long time had a different impact on me. If you&#39;re making a living you&#39;re doing pretty good. You don&#39;t need to be out there trying to make more money. You&#39;ve already made it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I also talked to my grandpa Jack and he said he never had a job he liked until late in his career when he got to take stock of inventory, so he was glad I was doing something I enjoyed. For some reason I forgot that I am lucky to even have the opportunity to do something I&#39;m remotely interested in. The thing is I haven&#39;t been enjoying it. I&#39;ve been dreading it every day. There seems to be this pressure to do more and be better. There is a pressure to be the best I can on any given day because it&#39;s my profession. I&#39;m a professional programmer. Which sounds nuts, but is actually true. Having a profession or any job for that matter seems to define you in some way. This is the very reason that the barber asked me what I did for a living so early on, and is why you have business cards. Business cards are a super short summary of what you are good at on a tiny piece of paper with contact information included. It&#39;s nuts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While it&#39;s true and that it is my profession, it&#39;s not going to make or break me. I am still going to take it seriously, I&#39;m not going to slack off, sacrifice quality, or stop sharing my opinions when I believe they are right. However, even though Programming pays the bills right now. It&#39;s just a small facet of who I am as an individual and I have a lot of other hobbies I need to get back to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>I rewatched Stardust again while I was working on this post and found one of the lines fitting: &quot;There are </span><span class="c2">shop boys</span><span>&nbsp;and there are </span><span class="c2">boys</span><span>&nbsp;who </span><span class="c2">just</span><span>&nbsp;happen to work in </span><span class="c2">shops</span><span>&nbsp;for the time being.
