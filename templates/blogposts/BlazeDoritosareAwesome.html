            <span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told myself today that my only goal for the entire day was to write a blog post for my website, so instead of doing that I&rsquo;ve been procrastinating all day. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry if this post is lacking any real substance. Eventually I want to write about my trips to Colorado, about a simple Alexa app, and maybe do some book reviews, but in my mind they seem like such large tasks that I can&rsquo;t seem to get myself to sit down to write them (At least not today).</span>

            <span class="c3">I never buy chips because I know they&rsquo;re unhealthy, and I have really bad self control. For no real reason yesterday I decided I would get some. I had some spicy Doritos before that were a part of the jacked line. I don&rsquo;t remember the flavor, but they were what I was looking for. Fortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t find them. The chip aisle had a few different flavors of Doritos, but I was dead set on getting a spicy version, and the spicy versions included poppin jalapeno, Jacked 3D jalapeno pepper jack (Which doesn&rsquo;t even look like a Doritos chip. It better resembles a 3D maze in a triangle shape), and Blaze. Blaze seemed closest to what I was looking for in color, so I went with it. I was a little afraid that it might be too hot to enjoy, but I bought them anyway.</span>

            <span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home I tripped as I started to step on the first step and as I caught my balance the chip bag was in between my leg and the steps and the bag made a loud plastic bag like ruffle. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time. I was feeling kind of embarrassed for tripping even though the only people who might have seen were some kids playing outside, so I hurried inside. I put away the rest of the groceries and got to the Doritos last. I really wanted to try them. As I went to open the bag I could smell them and thought, &ldquo;Oh shoot, If you can smell them through the bag these are going to be pretty strong.&rdquo; I picked them up and opened them as I did some fell out the bottom, and I realized I had popped the bag on the way inside. Felt like an idiot and put the bag in a plastic sack before trying the first chip.</span>

            <span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pulled out the first chip I realized that the powder on the chip wasn&rsquo;t evenly distributed and on this chip the red powder was mostly around the edges of the chip and the middle of the chip wasn&rsquo;t void of powder but was more of a orangish hue not unlike a regular Doritos chip but that&rsquo;s not to say that there was also some orange powder because there wasn&rsquo;t it was more like the natural color of the chip combined with less red powder produced this orange hue. I took a bite of the chip and I was first hit with what seemed to be a large amount of spices. It was good, but I was impatiently waiting for the heat to kick in. As it finally did it was spicy but not unbearable. As the heat began to decline my arm grabbed another chip and presented it to my face. I obliged and ate it.</span>

            <span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fist full of chips later I had to force myself to stop eating them to cook a proper dinner. I went ahead and cut up a chicken placing the chicken breasts in an oiled pan and the wings, legs, and saddle in a gallon freezer bag of which went in the fridge. As the chicken cooked I went back to eating the chips. By the time the chicken was done I had eaten around half the bag. I took a break from the chips to eat the chicken, but went back to eating them when I was done. I had to force myself to stop eating them again before I ate the whole bag. This morning I had the rest of them for breakfast&hellip;</span>
