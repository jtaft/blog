She recently left for another job in the hopes that it would get her closer to a job she wants to do. I&#39;m posting it here because I was too chicken to actually give it to her, but I really enjoy some parts of it and have spent more time than I probably should have on it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonally the first couple of drafts came out a little lecture-y, and probably too intense in the advice section. This draft seems to have come off better. If anyone reads this and would like me to expand on or doesn&#39;t agree with anything written feel free to let me know and I might do a follow up. I realize that the intended audience will probably never read this. I hope the rest of you enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dear Bullwinkle,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry if this is awkward. Let me explain. For the last couple of years, I&#39;ve started to make resolutions on my Birthday. This allows me to do a first-quarter review on New Years, so I can check my progress and make changes. One of my resolutions this year is to write more, but I often struggle with what to write or get stuck on a topic, so my goal is to write a &#39;Thank You&#39; letter for every gift I get this year (You see how this is all your fault). This also has a side benefit of giving me an excuse to use the typewriter I bought a while back. At first, I thought I could maybe get out of writing this letter because I didn&#39;t have your address so there was no way to mail you the letter, but unfortunately the goal is to write more, not mail more stuff.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, you started to &quot;forget&quot; to add my iced tea to my bill. I&#39;m not actually sure when you started to &quot;forget&quot; to add my iced tea to my bill, but I caught it one day and you explained that you had been deliberately not adding my tea to my bill. You see, the thing is, the only reason I was ordering tea in the first place was to run my bill up a little so I could tip a little more and not seem irresponsible. I&#39;d honestly rather just have water most days, but I also don&#39;t want to seem cheap. By taking the tea off my bill you created a whole new conundrum... Do I now pay it forward and tip higher? Maybe pretend that the tea is still on the bill and tip according to that higher total? and risk rewarding a bad behavior, reinforcing it, potentially to a degree that it continues in the future at such a rabid rate that disciplinary action is taken, and that at the height of the rabid &quot;giving of free drinks&quot; I am not only complicit in the wrongdoing but had set up financial incentives for said wrongdoing. Or do I tip below average? Or not at all? Punishing the bad behavior at risk of ruining your opinion of me. Under the best circumstances making you mad enough to add it back, so I could then start tipping to reinforce the appropriate behavior. Under the worst circumstances, you might start avoiding me or just deliberately giving me bad service. Obviously, the right thing to do is not to tip at all and I wish I could say I did the right thing here, but I ended up paying it forward the first time and then going back to a random base tip amount. I don&#39;t always think things all the way through, and way risks properly. I&#39;ve learned my lesson &nbsp;;) . Thanks for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(Disclaimer: Events that occur in the previous or any future paragraph may or may not be fiction.

Like, I kind of already thanked you for it the next week, but like, I&#39;m going to thank you again. I already told you about how I LOVE my mom&#39;s pumpkin pie. Like how my mom made a pie for me one time in college and I was waiting for the perfect day to eat it, you know, like because it can really turn a day around. Then finally one day I like went to class and this guy runs right into me, like it was unavoidable, he wasn&#39;t paying attention, like on his phone and stuff, and I didn&#39;t have time to get out of the way. Anyway, I had a Pumpkin Spice Latte from Starbucks that went all over the hallway, so I ran to the bathroom and threw some paper towels on it. I would have cleaned it up, I really would have, but I didn&#39;t have time, like I was on my way to class when he ran into me so I was already going to be late, and then to top it all off the teacher called on me when I didn&#39;t even raise my hand, like if I knew the answer I would have raised my hand. Whatever. Anyway, I got back to my dorm and wanted to finally eat a piece of pumpkin pie to end this Nightmare, but when I pulled it out it had mold all over it. Like Really, you know. All That, and now the pumpkin pie is all Moldy?! So I called my mom to tell her about it. She just didn&#39;t understand At All! She was just like, things spoil, you have to eat them before they spoil, like I Know That, but like how was I supposed to know a pumpkin pie wouldn&#39;t make it four weeks? Ugh. Whatever. Anyway, I didn&#39;t let the pumpkin sandwich cookie spoil, and it was delicious! Thanks for that (Sorry for stealing your joke).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks before you left you covered a dessert for me when I was having a rough week. We had a code deployment that went bad. There was an outage for the last half of the day, and I&#39;m pretty much responsible for it. I mean, QA is supposed to be able to do the deployments, but they don&#39;t have any technical knowledge, and the QA position was just outsourced to India. We shouldn&#39;t have deployed during the day (since it isn&#39;t automated), which was kind of my bosses call, but he did ask me and I told him it would probably be fine. The rest is my fault though. The recovery time and the outage in the first place are pretty much my fault. My boss did ask someone else to help me out and I think that did slow me down, but I probably could have just told him I had it under control and didn&#39;t need help (There&#39;s also a difference between help and taking over, and he just took over. Whatever, I&#39;m not bitter about it.. ). So, I was having a rough week. Mostly doing damage control on failed orders for the outage period and trying to convince another team that some code that I had developed for them was working in Production as expected. I was stressed out. At lunch, I told you I was still having a rough week and at the end of my meal you ended up covering my dessert. That small act of kindness turned my week around. I went back to work with a better attitude and everyone else seemed to follow suit. I&#39;m very confident that I would have ruined the rest of my week if it wasn&#39;t for you, so thanks for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rest of this letter will be the advice section. Feel free to skip it if it gets too lecture-y or if you just don&#39;t want the advice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursue what you love. Eventually, you&#39;ll find something you are passionate about and can make a living at. In Ray Dalio&#39;s book Principles, he says that there are two types of employees: those that work for a mission, and those that work for a paycheck. Employers want employees who work for a mission. Employees who are passionate about their work are going to have creative ideas, stand up for those ideas, and try to create a better product or service. Employees who are working for a paycheck are just trying to get through the day and are not as dedicated to the craft. I&#39;m not saying that people who work for a paycheck don&#39;t sometimes have good creative ideas, or don&#39;t work very hard. Sometimes they do, but it takes more effort when you&#39;re working for a paycheck. When you&#39;re passionate about your job you put in the extra work naturally.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">I&#39;m not trying to say that there&#39;s anything wrong with making a paycheck or working a job exclusively for a paycheck. Derek Sivers says that the happiest people he knows work for a paycheck and spend their extra income on their hobbies. I&#39;m trying to spend more time and money on my hobbies even though I&#39;ve already turned one of my hobbies into a job. Lately, I&#39;ve been struggling with getting anything done, so don&#39;t assume I have it all figured out. I can say, from experience, if you turn one of your hobbies into a job it might turn into work and it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to do more of the same when you get home. In my field especially, some people like to try to gauge whether or not someone is passionate about the subject by how much time they spend on it outside of work. This reasoning is flawed. You&#39;re already spending eight hours a day thinking about and working on the subject. Don&#39;t feel obligated to do the same thing when you get home. I think that again in my field there&#39;s this cliched story that the media likes to run about some kid getting rich by making an app or something and it baits people into wasting time on things that are founded on making money and not providing a good experience or service, or even making something interesting. I&#39;m not saying that you should give up on your hobby that you&#39;ve turned into a job. Just that when you&#39;re working on it as a hobby it should be fun. You shouldn&#39;t have to work two jobs. Also, If you end up spending an increasing amount of time on work you may end up making your job a large part of your identity and if you lose your job, for whatever reason, you may lose your sense of identity. I think it&#39;s also possible that you might take criticism more personally since your identity is wrapped up so closely with the work. In Robert Greene&#39;s book Mastery, he proposes that diversifying your interests will make you more creative. He also thinks that someone is most creative in their thirties and one&#39;s entire twenties should be spent figuring out what they are interested in, so they can take advantage of their knowledge in their thirties. I really like this idea, and it&#39;s largely why I&#39;ve started to spend more on my hobbies, but I also think that it is harder to learn something new than to do something you&#39;re already good at, so be aware that there might be a barrier to entry to a lot of hobbies before they&#39;re actually enjoyable. It&#39;s also maybe harder to finish projects than to start a new one (Maybe that&#39;s just me), but don&#39;t forget that you can always put down a hobby and pick it up later.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">There&#39;s going to be a point when you mess up or start having some difficulty at work. Refrain from finger-pointing. A lot of the time the cause will be some form of miscommunication or oversight. There&#39;s usually a process in place to avoid these types of things. Don&#39;t be afraid to attack the process. If the error is repeated either by you or another employee there&#39;s likely either something missing in the process or there are too many steps in the process and something is getting lost. You&#39;re smart. Stand up for your ideas. If they have a good reason for the process don&#39;t be afraid to change your mind, but don&#39;t agree just to avoid conflict! Don&#39;t accept that &quot;that&#39;s just the way things are&quot;. There needs to be a reason for every step in the process. If a step doesn&#39;t have a reason, and it is possibly hindering you, there&#39;s no reason why you shouldn&#39;t propose that it be removed, at the very least, temporarily. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask if you can talk to other departments if they&#39;re the excuse given. Eventually, you&#39;ll get to the root of the problem and get it fixed.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Don&#39;t expect everyone to like you. If you come in with passion, a high work ethic, and new ideas there will be some people who don&#39;t agree with you. Do your best to see things from their perspective. Again, don&#39;t give in just to avoid conflict! Hopefully, you can prove that you&#39;re on the same team and want the same things. If not, see book recommendations.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">Read. Reading is probably the most helpful thing I do when things get difficult at work. I tend to feel pretty alone when there&#39;s conflict at work. Kind of like there&#39;s no one on my side. It just feels like there&#39;s this attitude that this is the way things work, it&#39;s the same way they&#39;ve worked for the last ten years, and why should we listen to you? You&#39;ve only been here a year and all these other employees have ten to twenty years in the industry and have worked at the company at least half of that. This is where reading comes in for me. It&#39;s really hard to combat this type of argument because it&#39;s ageist, and not something you can fix. However, If you can point to a book that details your views, it&#39;s much harder to invalidate your point. &nbsp;Even if you don&#39;t end up citing your source, if you have this background of knowledge, you&#39;ll go into a meeting with more confidence because you know your idea is backed up in literature. Sometimes I like to imagine all the authors of the books I&#39;ve read in a crowd behind me having my back. This usually gives me a little boost of confidence when I need it. Also, don&#39;t be afraid to reread some of the good ones. Sometimes the right things don&#39;t jump out at you until you need them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here are a few book recommendations:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Softcore Interpersonal Skills - Dale Carnegie - How to Win Friends and Influence People</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(I liked the book. I&#39;m just not the smile and wave, you know, &quot;Good Morning!&quot; type)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Hardcore Interpersonal Skills - Robert Greene - The 48 Laws of Power</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(I love everything by Robert Greene. This book is the best at helping you figure out people&#39;s motivations. The tone or length may put off some people. I&#39;ve listened to it narrated by the author and it was really good so that&#39;s an option. The book is pretty expensive, so if you&#39;re on the fence he wrote a sequel with 50 cent called The 50th Law that is a little shorter and in the same style and same topic, so it may be a better introduction to his style so you can at least test the waters before you commit to a larger book. His book Mastery is also good if you&#39;re still trying to figure out how to manage your life)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Life &amp; Work - Ray Dalio - Principles</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(Cited earlier. This book is great for thinking about problems in the right way and forming principles to live by)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For Life - Ryan Holiday - Ego is the Enemy</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(I&#39;m a big fan of Ryan&#39;s work too. He mentored under Robert Greene. This book is part of a trilogy. This one is the best (IMHO). If you just want the cliff notes I&#39;d recommend Stillness is the Key it&#39;s an easy read but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s one you will likely revisit when things get hard. Obstacle is the Way is also good, but I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve gotten anything out of it that I didn&#39;t get out of Ego. I probably need to reread it though)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">You&#39;ll probably also want to pick up a book or two related to your profession. They can be really helpful when you know something is a best practice but don&#39;t know how to explain why they are best practices (Might not be possible if you work in a non-technical field. I don&#39;t know.. You&#39;ll figure it out).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For example:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It has been really useful to me when I&#39;m really frustrated about how things are run at work. Even if you know what you&#39;re doing is right, it&#39;s still sometimes nice to have a confirmation that you&#39;re actually doing the right thing when everyone around you doesn&#39;t share the same views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1">You asked me for advice before you left, and the best thing I could come up with was, &quot;Big-girl job, big-girl stress. Find a way to deal with it&quot;. It&#39;s hard to give solid advice when you could be interrupted at any second. Sorry If I went a little overboard with the advice in this letter. I thought I was going to cut out a lot of it to improve the tone of the letter, but I ended up leaving most of it in. I just hope you find something in it that was useful or enjoyable. Anyway, I wish you all the best on your journey. I hope it ends up better than you can even imagine. Until our paths cross again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Best Wishes,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jack Taft</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sooo If you&#39;re reading this and you&#39;ve given me a gift recently and are now wondering where your letter is... and like, why does she get a letter first...
